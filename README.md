# Nodevision
Nodevision is a Node.js based web development environment with a special focus on Note taking and Graph visualizations of project directories made with love and generative AIs.

# Authorship and AI usage.
Nodevision is under development by Henry Holben using generative AIs including ChatGPT, Claude AI, and Replit.

I have also used a code example from this site: https://michilehr.de/overwrite-cmds-and-ctrls-in-javascript/
